**Title**

A Multi-step Final Project for the Learn JavaScript Online course by Jad Joubran
(https://github.com/jadjoubran)

**About**

This is the final project for the course [Learn JavaScript Online](https://learnjavascript.online). The project is a
food tracker app that allows users to track their meals and calories.The app is built in a series of steps, each step
building on the previous step. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are used and no frameworks. Currently, as of 04.06.2023, this
is the first step of the project. I will try and update the README as I add more steps to the project but don't hold me
to it. ðŸ˜… I provided the initial boilerplate code for the project for those that are interested. But the rest of
the code (the `index.js` file) is written by the students of the course. I've opted to _not_ use the
`fetch-wrapper.js` for better or worse, mainly because I wanted to see how everything works without it.
