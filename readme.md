**Title**

A Multi-step Final Project for the Learn JavaScript Online course by Jad Joubran

**About**

This is the final project for the course [Learn JavaScript Online](https://learnjavascript.online). The project is a
food tracker app that allows users to track their meals and calories.The app is built in a series of steps, each step
building on the previous step. No frameworks used, just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Currently, as of 04.06.2023, this
is the first step of the project. I will *try* and update the README as I add more steps to the project but...

I included the initial boilerplate code for the project for those that are interested. The rest of
the code (the `index.js` file) is written by the students of the course. I've opted to _not_ use the
`fetch-wrapper.js` for better or worse, mainly because I wanted to see how everything works without it. 

(*) Note: I know have a new level of respect for front-end JavaScript developers!!! 🙇🏻‍♂️🧙🏻‍ 😅
